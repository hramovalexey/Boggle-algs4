# Boggle-algs4
My solution for programming assignment "Boggle" at Algorithms, Part II by Princeton University 
Due to the limits of the Princeton course explicit class deriving is prohibited. So my solution includes class ExtTrieST.java wich is a modified version of Princeton's class TrieST.java
Also solution uses other Princeton's classes: BoggleBoard.java, In.java, SET.java, StdOut.java.
Programming assignment itself can be found here:
